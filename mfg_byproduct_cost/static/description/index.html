              <p>
             In Odoo manufacturing module, by default, no material cost is allocated to the by-products manufactured therefore full production cost is charged to main finished goods (FG).

                1) Set by-product valuation method as Standard Cost and input cost on product form of the by-product.<br/>
                2) Standard Cost of by-product will be reduced from overall manufacturing cost of FG through
                customization.<br/>
                3) By-products quantity will be updated on given cost through default odoo functionality.<br/>

                The by-products are set on the BoM of a specific product. Two additional columns are created through

                Odoo default Cost Analysis report is also customized.
                The Finished Good manufactured is received at the average unit cost, if the costing method is set as
                AVCO or at Standard cost if the costing method is set as Standard Price.
                The By-Products are received on standard cost as set on the product form in Odoo.<br/>
                The cost of raw materials is reduced by the value of total By-Products produced, as can be seen in the
                picture below.
